# 🎮 Underground Hero

**Underground Hero** is a serious game that helps students learn the difference between **Requirements** and **Design** in software engineering. The game presents a high-stakes mission where players must classify software elements correctly to save hostages and progress through increasingly challenging levels.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Many students struggle with distinguishing between abstract software engineering concepts like requirements and design (Sommerville, 2015). This game turns those abstract ideas into urgent and memorable gameplay.

- **Problem**: Confusion between requirements and design in academic and practical tasks.
- **Opportunity**: Use gamification to make learning interactive and emotionally engaging.

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- **Objective**: Classify each statement as a *Requirement* or *Design* before time runs out.
- **Game Loop**:
  1. Login
  2. Read the scenario
  3. Classify each element
  4. Submit responses
  5. Rescue hostages
  6. Proceed to next level or retry

- **Mechanics**: 
  - Urgency creates emotional involvement.
  - Misclassifications lead to dramatic consequences.
  - Progression through levels enhances retention.

## 🧪 Prototype & Teamwork

- **Tools Used**:
  - UML for system modeling
  - Figma for UI/UX prototyping

- **Team**: 7 students contributing to design, development, and testing

---

## 📊 Play Testing

- Players were immersed in the narrative and urgency.
- Feedback focused on:
  - UI clarity
  - Timing pressure
  - Overall enjoyment

- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher concept retention
  - Stronger engagement through time pressure and narrative

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add more levels and narrative depth
- Introduce sound effects and voiceovers
- Create a multiplayer leaderboard for competitive learning
- Improve backend logic for smarter classification evaluation
